Big O:
It indicates the runtime change of an algorithm as we keep on changing the number of inputs.
An algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n), as n increases.[UPPER BOUND-WORST CASE]

Linear----O(n)
for(i=0;i<n;i++){}

Quadratic---O(n^2)
for(i=0;i<n;i++){
    for(j=0;j<n;j++){

    }
}


Constant----O(1)
let k=n;
